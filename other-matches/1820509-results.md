**Detailed Evaluation:**

* You have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, which meets the minimum qualification.

* However, your experience is mostly in full-stack development, and you don't have direct experience in:
	+ C/C++ programming (only 3+ years required, but you don't mention it)
	+ Embedded and/or Operating System Kernel development (3+ years required)
	+ Device driver development (3+ years required)
* Your experience with languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python might be relevant, but not directly mentioned as required.

**Recommendation:**

While you meet some of the minimum qualifications, you seem to be missing key qualifications required for the role. I would not recommend applying for this position as a strong fit. However, if you're interested in the company and role, you may still consider applying, but be prepared to address the gaps in your experience.
